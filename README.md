# ruby-thetvdb

A simple gem for accessing the [www.thetvdb.com API](http://thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API). Created by Jon Furrer.

While there are a few TVDB gems out there, there were some features I wanted that I didn't find in others. Among these are:

  * Ability to get information for series episodes using the series id, season number and episode number
  * Easy access to all info from a series, season or episode

## Installation

    $ sudo gem install ruby-thetvdb

### Usage
